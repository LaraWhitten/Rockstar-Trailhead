The final project for this class is a one page website designed to collect email addresses and promote a freemium. Since I don't have any music online at all (I only have a couple of starter pieces up on YouTube that also are not music)up I didn't add the MailerLite code yet to collect emails. I do have it ready to put in generated from their website. i need music to put on it. My story is long and I want to put it on a seperate blog because I don't want to have to suffer through it again everytime I look at my website. So, it's always going to be light on real personal information. Actually, this should have the components in order perhaps not ideally but accounted for. Design problems are something I expect because it takes me awhile with layout type things and I'm terrible with Canva.com type things. I expect my compoistion generally to be strong.
